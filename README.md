Welcome to **Dispatch4j** - a simple, high-performance CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) 
command dispatcher library for Java 21+! Built with simplicity and performance in mind. 
.

## ‚ú® Why Dispatch4j?

We believe that implementing CQRS patterns shouldn't be complicated. Dispatch4j was born from the need for a lightweight, yet powerful solution that:

- **Just Works** - Minimal configuration with sensible defaults
- **Stays Out of Your Way** - Clean, annotation-based approach that feels natural
- **Scales With You** - From small projects to enterprise applications
- **Embraces Modern Java** - Leveraging Java 21+ features for cleaner, more efficient code

Whether you're building microservices, modular monoliths, or event-driven systems, Dispatch4j provides the foundation you need to separate your commands, queries, and events effectively.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Simple, Intuitive API** - Get started in minutes with our annotation-based approach
- **Spring Boot Integration** - Seamless integration with automatic handler discovery
- **Standalone Mode** - Use without any framework dependencies
- **Async Support** - Built-in CompletableFuture support for non-blocking operations
- **Type Safety** - Compile-time checking with strong typing
- **Thread-Safe** - Production-ready concurrent execution
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Core module only requires SLF4J

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.dispatch4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>dispatch4j-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```kotlin
implementation("io.github.dispatch4j:dispatch4j-spring-boot-starter:1.0.0")
```

### Quick Example

Define your command:
```java
@Command
public record CreateOrderCommand(String customerId, List<String> items) {}
```

Create a handler:
```java
@Component
public class OrderService {
    @CommandHandler
    public OrderCreatedEvent handle(CreateOrderCommand command) {
        // Your business logic here
        return new OrderCreatedEvent(orderId, command.customerId());
    }
}
```

Dispatch commands:
```java
@RestController
public class OrderController {
    private final Dispatcher dispatcher;

    @PostMapping("/orders")
    public ResponseEntity<String> createOrder(@RequestBody CreateOrderRequest request) {
        var command = new CreateOrderCommand(request.customerId(), request.items());
        var event = dispatcher.send(command);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Order created: " + event.orderId());
    }
}
```

That's it! Dispatch4j automatically discovers your handlers and wires everything together.
